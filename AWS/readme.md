# ☁️ AWS Projects  

This repository showcases my **AWS projects**, where I document what I’ve learned and built using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  

## 🔹 What is AWS?  

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a cloud computing platform that provides a range of services, including computing power, storage, networking, and databases. It allows businesses and developers to **deploy, manage, and scale applications** without needing physical hardware.  

### **Key AWS Services I Use:**  
- **EC2** – Virtual machines for running applications  
- **S3** – Cloud storage for files and backups  
- **IAM** – Identity and Access Management for security  
- **VPC** – Networking to control cloud resources  
- **RDS** – Managed databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
- **Route 53** – Domain name and DNS management  

## 📌 AWS Projects in This Repository  

This repository includes:  
✅ Hands-on AWS projects and experiments  
✅ Terraform configurations for infrastructure automation  
✅ Networking setups using **VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups**  
✅ AWS CLI commands and scripts  

I’ll continue updating this repo as I **learn more and build new projects**. 🚀
